# RTK-SyncLab

## Description

RTK-SyncLab is a testing lab built with React, Vite, and Redux Toolkit, designed to explore efficient state management patterns. This project allows hands-on experimentation with:

- Adding and removing items from different slices of state
- Resetting shared state via global actions
- Using `extraReducers` to synchronize changes across multiple reducers

It is a minimal yet effective sandbox to understand how Redux Toolkit simplifies state logic in real-world applications.

## Technologies Used

- React – Frontend library for building UI components
- Vite – Fast build tool and development environment
- Redux Toolkit – Standard approach for writing Redux logic
- React Redux – Official bindings between React and Redux
- Bulma CSS – Lightweight and responsive CSS framework
- Faker.js – Random data generation for movies and songs
